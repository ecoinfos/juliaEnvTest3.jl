Petersburg wager -- Rico -- Blowing up -- Signal and noise In 1956 two Bell Labs scientists discovered the formula for getting rich. One was mathematician Claude Shannon, neurotic father of our digital age; the other was John L. Kelly, Jr., a Texas-born, gun-toting physicist. Together they applied information theory--the basis of computers and the Internet--to the problem of making as much money as possible, as fast as possible. Shannon and MIT mathematician Edward O. Thorp took the "Kelly formula" to the tables of Las Vegas. It worked. They realized that there was even more money in the stock market, specifically in the risky trading known as arbitrage. Shannon became a successful investor, using his wealth to drop out of the scientific world. This book traces how the Kelly formula sparked controversy even as it made fortunes at racetracks, casinos, and trading desks.--From publisher description},

Written not from a post-crisis perspective - but from a preventative point of view - this book traces the development of financial derivatives from bonds to credit default swaps, and shows how mathematical formulas went beyond pricing to expand their use to the point where they dwarfed the real economy. You'll learn how the deadly allure of their ice-cold beauty has misled generations of economists and investors, and how continued reliance on these formulas can either assist future economic development, or send the global economy into the financial equivalent of a cardiac arrest. Rather than rehash tales of post-crisis fallout, this book focuses on preventing the next one. By exploring the heart of the shadow economy, you'll be better prepared to ride the rough waves of finance into the turbulent future. Delve into one of the world's least-understood but highest-impact industries Understand the key principles of quantitative finance and the evolution of the field Learn what quantitative finance has become, and how it affects us all Discover how the industry's next steps dictate the economy's future How do you create a quadrillion dollars out of nothing, blow it away and leave a hole so large that even years of "quantitative easing" can't fill it - and then go back to doing the same thing? Even amidst global recovery, the financial system still has the potential to seize up at any moment. The Money Formula explores the how and why of financial disaster, what must happen to prevent the next one"-- "The book is divided into two main parts. The first dips into the history of quantitative finance and explains its key principles, the second is about the quantitative finance industry today and how it is evolving.

Some of the stories include: - A trader who turned an initial account of \$2,500 into \$50 million. - A trader who achieved an average annual return of 337\% over a 13-year period. - A trader who made tens of millions using a unique approach that employed neither fundamental nor technical analysis. - A former advertising executive who used classical chart analysis to achieve a 58\% average annual return over a 27-year trading span. - A promising junior tennis player in the UK who abandoned his quest for a professional sporting career for trading and generated a nine-year track record with an average annual return just under 300\%.  World-renowned author and trading expert Jack D. Schwager is our guide. His trademark knowledgeable and sensitive interview style encourages the Wizards to reveal the fascinating details of their training, experience, tactics, strategies, and their best and worst trades. There are dashes of humour and revelations about the human side of trading throughout"-- Amazon},

	abstract = {Dynamic asset allocation strategies that are continuously rebalanced so as to always keep a fixed constant proportion of wealth invested in the various assets at each point in time play a fundamental role in the theory of optimal portfolio strategies. In this paper we study the
              rate of return on investment
              , defined here as the net gain in wealth divided by the cumulative investment, for such investment strategies in continuous time. Among other results, we prove that the limiting distribution of this measure of return is a gamma distribution. This limit theorem allows for comparisons of different strategies. For example, the mean return on investment is maximized by the same strategy that maximizes logarithmic utility, which is also known to maximize the exponential rate at which wealth grows. The return from this policy turns out to have other stochastic dominance properties as well. We also study the
              return on the risky investment alone
              , defined here as the present value of the gain from investment divided by the present value of the cumulative investment in the risky asset needed to achieve the gain. We show that for the log-optimal, or optimal growth policy, this return tends to an exponential distribution. We compare the return from the optimal growth policy with the return from a policy that invests a constant amount in the risky stock. We show that for the case of a single risky investment, the constant investor's expected return is twice that of the optimal growth policy. This difference can be considered the cost for insuring that the proportional investor does not go bankrupt.},

	abstract = {We study a variety of optimal investment problems for objectives related to attaining goals by a fixed terminal time. We start by finding the policy that
              maximizes the probability of reaching a given wealth level by a given fixed terminal time
              , for the case where an investor can allocate his wealth at any time between
              n
              + 1 investment opportunities:
              n
              risky stocks, as well as a risk-free asset that has a positive return. This generalizes results recently obtained by Kulldorff and Heath for the case of a single investment opportunity. We then use this to solve related problems for cases where the investor has an external source of
              income
              , and where the investor is interested solely in
              beating the return of a given stochastic benchmark
              , as is sometimes the case in institutional money management. One of the benchmarks we consider for this last problem is that of the return of the optimal growth policy, for which the resulting controlled process is a supermartingale. Nevertheless, we still find an optimal strategy. For the general case, we provide a thorough analysis of the optimal strategy, and obtain new insights into the behavior of the optimal policy. For one special case, namely that of a single stock with constant coefficients, the optimal policy is independent of the underlying drift. We explain this by exhibiting a correspondence between the probability maximizing results and the pricing and hedging of a particular derivative security, known as a digital or binary option. In fact, we show that for this case, the
              optimal policy to maximize the probability of reaching a given value of wealth by a predetermined time is equivalent to simply buying a European digital option with a particular strike price and payoff
              . A similar result holds for the general case, but with the stock replaced by a particular (index) portfolio, namely the optimal growth or log-optimal portfolio.},

Each individual volume in the series presents an accurate self-contained survey of a sub-field of finance, suitable for use by finance and economics professors and lecturers, professional researchers, graduate students and as a teaching supplement. It is fitting that the series Handbooks in Finance devotes a handbook to Asset and Liability Management. Volume 2 focuses on applications and case studies in asset and liability management. The growth in knowledge about practical asset and liability modeling has followed the popularity of these models in diverse business settings. This volume portrays ALM in practice, in contrast to Volume 1, which addresses the theories and methodologies behind these models. In original articles practitioners and scholars describe and analyze models used in banking, insurance, money management, individual investor financial planning, pension funds, and social security. They put the traditional purpose of ALM, to control interest rate and liquidity risks, into rich and broad-minded frameworks. Readers interested in other business settings will find their discussions of financial institutions both instructive and revealing. * Focuses on pragmatic applications * Relevant to a variety of risk-management industries * Analyzes models used in most financial sectors},

Despite this success, the model is fundamentally at odds with the observed behavior of option markets: a graph of implied volatilities against strike will typically display a curve or skew, which practitioners refer to as the smile, and which the model cannot explain. Option valuation is not a solved problem, and the past forty years have witnessed an abundance of new models that try to reconcile theory with markets. The Volatility Smile presents a unified treatment of the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the more advanced models that have replaced it. It is also a book about the principles of financial valuation and how to apply them. Celebrated author and quant Emanuel€Derman and Michael B. Miller explain not just the mathematics but the ideas behind the models. By examining the foundations, the implementation, and the pros and cons of various models, and by carefully exploring their derivations and their assumptions, readers will learn not only how to handle the volatility smile but how to evaluate and build their own financial models.
